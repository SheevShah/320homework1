What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge simply updates the changes from two repositories as a commit in 
the branch history while a rebase moves back to a snapshot of the code, 
resetting the branch history to start at that point.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is filesystem that is hosted somewhere on the network 
or the internet, but not on your local machine. Typically it is hosted on 
a server accessible to all collaborators of the project.
